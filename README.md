# 🎬 Subtitle Studio

**Subtitle Studio** is a web application that lets you add instant notes to videos from your live camera, local files, or YouTube. These notes are converted into timestamped subtitle files (.vtt) and can be downloaded together with the video as a ZIP archive. The interface supports multiple languages and features voice typing for easy note entry.
